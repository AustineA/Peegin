            Use the search box to search for words that you would love
            to find the meaning to and if you have a word you want to add, feel free
            to visit peegin.com and click on the ‘Define a New Word’ button to add a new pidgin to the dictionary.</p>

            <p style="font-size:19px;">
              Also, our mobile app for android makes it easy for you to access words on the go
              without any hassle. No more getting lost in the market or bus because you can’t
              understand some pidgin words/slangs, it’s a part of you now.
