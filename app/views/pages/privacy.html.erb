             <p style="font-size:19px;">
               A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies are required to use some Peegin.com services.

                 information in cookies set by the Ad Partners. Web beacons enable our Ad Partners to recognize a unique cookie on
